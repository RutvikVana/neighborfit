      <h1>About NeighborFit üè°</h1>
      <p>
        NeighborFit is a smart lifestyle-neighborhood matching platform that helps users find their ideal neighborhood based on preferences like rent affordability, safety, education, and park accessibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system compares real neighborhood data from across India and uses a matching algorithm to return neighborhoods that best fit the user's lifestyle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this project is to demonstrate how data-driven applications can simplify real estate and lifestyle decisions for everyday users.
